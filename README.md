AWS Secrets Manager helps protect the credentials that are needed to access databases, applications, services, and other IT resources. With Secrets Manager, you can rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. Users and applications retrieve secrets by making a Secrets Manager API call, eliminating the need to hardcode sensitive information in plaintext. Secrets Manager offers [secret rotation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_turn-on-for-db.html) with built-in integration for Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility).

method authorization type for the APIs to COGNITO_USER_POOLS.
5) A developer is building a new application that transforms text files to .pdf files. A separate application writes the text files to a source Amazon S3 bucket. The new application must read the files as they arrive in Amazon S3 and must convert the files to .pdf files by using an AWS Lambda function. The developer has written an IAM policy to allow access to Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
What should the developer do to ensure that the Lambda function has the correct permissions?
A) Create a Lambda execution role by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Attach the IAM policy to the role. Assign the Lambda execution role to the Lambda function.
B) Create a Lambda execution user by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Attach the IAM policy to the user. Assign the Lambda execution user to the Lambda function.
C) Create a Lambda execution role by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Attach the IAM policy to the role. Store the IAM role as an environment variable in the Lambda function.
D) Create a Lambda execution user by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Attach the IAM policy to the user. Store the IAM user credentials as environment variables in the Lambda function.
6) A developer is working on an application that stores highly confidential data in a database. The developer must use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) with envelope encryption to protect the data.
How should the developer configure the data encryption to meet these requirements?
A) Encrypt the data by using a KMS key. Store the encrypted data in the database.
B) Encrypt the data by using a generated data key. Store the encrypted data in the database.
C) Encrypt the data by using a generated data key. Store the encrypted data and the data key ID in the
database.
D) Encrypt the data by using a generated data key. Store the encrypted data and the encrypted data key in
the database.



7) A developer is adding Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached to a company's existing record storage application. The developer has decided to use lazy loading based on an analysis of common record handling patterns.
Which pseudocode example will correctly implement lazy loading?
A) record_value = db.query("UPDATE Records SET Details = {1} WHERE ID == {0}", record_key, record_value)
cache.set (record_key, record_value)
B) record_value = cache.get(record_key)
if (record_value == NULL)
record_value = db.query("SELECT Details FROM Records WHERE ID == {0}",
record_key) cache.set (record_key, record_value)
C) record_value = cache.get (record_key)
db.query("UPDATE Records SET Details = {1} WHERE ID == {0}", record_key,
               record_value)
D) record_value = db.query("SELECT Details FROM Records WHERE ID == {0}",
                              record_key)
      if (record_value != NULL)
cache.set (record_key, record_value)
8) A developer is building a web application that uses Amazon API Gateway. The developer wants to maintain different environments for development (dev) and production (prod) workloads. The API will be backed by an AWS Lambda function with two aliases: one for dev and one for prod.
How can the developer maintain these environments with the LEAST amount of configuration?
A) Create a REST API for each environment. Integrate the APIs with the corresponding dev and prod aliases of the Lambda function. Deploy the APIs to their respective stages. Access the APIs by using the stage URLs.
B) Create one REST API. Integrate the API with the Lambda function by using a stage variable in place of an alias. Deploy the API to two different stages: dev and prod. Create a stage variable in each stage with different aliases as the values. Access the API by using the different stage URLs.
C) Create one REST API. Integrate the API with the dev alias of the Lambda function. Deploy the API to the dev environment. Configure a canary release deployment for the prod environment where the canary will integrate with the Lambda prod alias.
D) Create one REST API. Integrate the API with the prod alias of the Lambda function. Deploy the API to the prod environment. Configure a canary release deployment for the dev environment where the canary will integrate with the Lambda dev alias.


9) A developer wants to track the performance of an application that runs on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The developer wants to view and track statistics, such as the average request latency and the maximum request latency, across the fleet. The developer wants to receive immediate notification if the average response time exceeds a threshold.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A) Configure a cron job on each EC2 instance to measure the response time and update a log file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket every minute. Use an Amazon S3 event notification to invoke an AWS Lambda function that reads the log file and writes new entries to an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster. Visualize the results in OpenSearch Dashboards. Configure OpenSearch Service to send an alert to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the response time exceeds the threshold.
B) Configure the application to write the response times to the system log. Install and configure the Amazon Inspector agent on the EC2 instances to continually read the logs and send the response times to Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events). View the metrics graphs in the EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) console. Configure an EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) custom rule to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when the average of the response time metric exceeds the threshold.
C) Configure the application to write the response times to a log file. Install and configure the Amazon CloudWatch agent on the EC2 instances to stream the application log to CloudWatch Logs. Create a metric filter of the response time from the log. View the metrics graphs in the CloudWatch console. Create a CloudWatch alarm to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when the average of the response time metric exceeds the threshold.
D) Install and configure AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) on the EC2 instances to monitor the response time and send the response time to Amazon CloudWatch as a custom metric. View the metrics graphs in Amazon QuickSight. Create a CloudWatch alarm to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when the average of the response time metric exceeds the threshold.
10) A developer is testing an application locally and has deployed the application to an AWS Lambda function. To avoid exceeding the deployment package size quota, the developer did not include the dependencies in the deployment file. When the developer tests the application remotely, the Lambda function does not run because of missing dependencies.
Which solution will resolve this issue?
A) Use the Lambda console editor to update the code and include the missing dependencies.
B) Create an additional .zip file that contains the missing dependencies. Include the .zip file in the original
Lambda deployment package.
C) Add references to the missing dependencies in the Lambda function's environment variables.
D) Create a layer that contains the missing dependencies. Attach the layer to the Lambda function.
